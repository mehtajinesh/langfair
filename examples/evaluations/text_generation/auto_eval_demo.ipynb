You should have one every year.\\n#Person2#: I know. I figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor?\\n#Person1#: Well, the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early. So try to come at least once a year for your own good.\\n#Person2#: Ok.\\n#Person1#: Let me see here. Your eyes and ears look fine. Take a deep breath, please. Do you smoke, Mr. Smith?\\n#Person2#: Yes.\\n#Person1#: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease, you know. You really should quit.\\n#Person2#: I've tried hundreds of times, but I just can't seem to kick the habit.\\n#Person1#: Well, we have classes and some medications that might help.

    "**Class Attributes:**\n",
    "- `prompts` - (**list of strings**)\n",
    "A list of input prompts for the model.\n",
    "- `responses` - (**list of strings, default=None**)\n",
    "A list of generated output from an LLM. If not available, responses are computed using the model.\n",
    "- `langchain_llm` (**langchain llm (BaseChatModel), default=None**) A langchain llm (`BaseChatModel`). \n",
    "- `suppressed_exceptions` (**tuple or dict, default=None**) If a tuple, specifies which exceptions to handle as 'Unable to get response' rather than raising the exception. If a dict, enables users to specify exception-specific failure messages with keys being subclasses of BaseException\n",
    "- `use_n_param` (**bool, default=False**) Specifies whether to use `n` parameter for `BaseChatModel`. Not compatible with all `BaseChatModel` classes. If used, it speeds up the generation process substantially when count > 1.\n",
    "- `metrics` - (**dict or list of str, default is all metrics**)\n",
    "Specifies which metrics to evaluate.\n",
    "- `counterfactual_transformer` - (**str, default=\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"**) Specifies which huggingface sentence transformer to use when computing cosine distance. See https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers?sort_models=likes#models for more information. The recommended sentence transformer is 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'. User can also specify a local path to a model.\n",
    "- `counterfactual_sentiment_classifier` - (**str, default=\"vader\"**) Specifies the sentiment classifier to use for counterfactual sentiment bias calculation.\n",
    "- `toxicity_device` - (**str or torch.device input or torch.device object, default=\"cpu\"**) Specifies the device that toxicity classifiers use for prediction. Set to \"cuda\" for classifiers to be able to leverage the GPU. Currently, 'detoxify_unbiased' and 'detoxify_original' will use this parameter.\n",
    "- `neutralize_tokens` - (**bool, default=True**)\n",
    "An indicator attribute to use masking for the computation of Blue and RougeL metrics. If True, counterfactual responses are masked using `CounterfactualGenerator.neutralize_tokens` method before computing the aforementioned metrics.\n",
    "- `max_calls_per_min` (**Deprecated as of 0.2.0**) Use LangChain's InMemoryRateLimiter instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Methods:**\n",
    "1. `evaluate` - Compute supported metrics and, optionally, response-level scores.\n",
    "\n",

    "    - `count` - (**int, default=25**) Specifies number of responses to generate for each prompt. \n",
    "    - `metrics` - (**dict or list of str, default=None**)\n",
    "    Specifies which metrics to evaluate if a change is desired from those specified in self.metrics.\n",
    "    - `return_data` : (**bool, default=False**)\n",
    "    Indicates whether to include response-level scores in results dictionary returned by this method.\n",
